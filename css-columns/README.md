# CSS Columns

- used for setting multiple columns
- The main properties availble here are
  - `colummns:<number> <max-width>` - shorthand for setting the number of columsn with width;
  - `column-rule` : for setting line between columns.
  - `column-gap` : set the gap between columns.
  - `column-span` : span on all columns.

Note:

- `white-space` : The css property that specifies how white space inside an element is handled
- The values it can take are `nowrap`, `normal`, `pre`(white space is preserved)

- When dealing with columns some heading may break in between columns, this can be avoided setting `break-inside` property to `avoid`
